# NET Slides Concept UI

Latest update: **03/30/2020.**

This is a work-in-progress sneak peek to the upcoming release of NET-Slides
Development B. Right now, the main selling point is its redone UI. At this
stage, its done purely with HTML+CSS with no JavaScript nor any external
middlemen. The final product will eventually employ some JavaScript for much of
its UI logic. No application logic has been injected yet.

All of this is done from scratch--minus some design elements carried over from
the [[**current public release**](https://BrendonIrwan.github.io/net-slides)].

Oh, and it should appear correctly on Chrome now.

Feel free to play around with it using your browser's developer tools.

Here are some magic tricks you can do:

- Append the `rtl` class to the body element. This forces the UI to render at
RTL mode.

- Append the `collapsed` class to each `fieldset.head.collapsible`, all of which
reside inside the right panel. This collapses all form fields under that
fieldset. Of course, JavaScript will be required for this to work like normal.

- Append the `dark-mode` class to the body element. This forces the UI to render
in "Dark Mode", something that you can't do in Google Slides!
